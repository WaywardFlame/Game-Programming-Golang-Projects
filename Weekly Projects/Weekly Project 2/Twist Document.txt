The Twist:
This rock-paper-scissors game revolves the player and the ai each
having their own 'fortress' that they have to defend from each other.
The fortresses have a limited amount of health available. In order to
defend their fortress, the player may engage in rock-paper-scissors (RPS),
choose the 'defend' option to negate incoming RPS damage, or use a 
randomly awarded item to deal ticking damage, immediate damage, or 
prevent the AI from engaging in RPS for a single round. Additionally,
successive victories at RPS will increase damage dealt from RPS.
So, each victory will provide an additional 5 damage from RPS, up to
a maximum 15 additional damage (3 victories). Losing at RPS will reset
the additional damage. Lastly, the AI's actions are not completely
random. There is 50% chance the AI will engage in RPS, a 30% chance of 
using an item (if no item is available, it will switch to defending),
and a 20% chance of defending. If the AI chooses to engage in RPS, it will
have additional weight applied that will affect what it chooses. This weight
ranges from 0 to 3. At 0 and 1 weight, the AI will randomly choose rock,
paper, or scissors. At 2 weight, the AI will use its choice of RPS from
the previous round. At 3 weight, the AI will attempt to predict what
the player will choose by picking the option of RPS that its previous
choice is strong against. So, if the AI chose paper, and the weight
becomes 3, it will choose rock in anticipation of the player choosing
scissors. The weight increases with each successive AI victory.
